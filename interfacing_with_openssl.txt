To compare ECB encryption with Openssl, you must launch openssl with this paramteters:
Key derivation alg: PBKDF2
iteration count: 8192
Hash algorith for PBKDF2: sha256

For example,
Encode with openssl:
openssl des-cbc -in Makefile -out encrypted -iter 8192 -md sha256
Decode with ft_ssl:
./ft_ssl des-cbc -d -i encrypted

You can also bypass this steps by providing directly the same encryption key (and initialization vector if needed) to both commands,
or get the key / iv from encryption and provide it to the decryption programm

Example:
./ft_ssl des-cbc -i ft_ssl -o encrypted -k ABCDEF1234567890 -v DEADBEEF42424242 --no_salt
(--no_salt because if we provide key and iv openssl does not expect salt at the beginning of the file)
openssl des-cbc -d -in encrypted -out decrypted -K ABCDEF1234567890 -iv DEADBEEF42424242
diff ft_ssl decrypted
